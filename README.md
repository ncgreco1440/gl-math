# gl-math

WebGL Mathematics Library

This is a small side project that I've created in my spare time while **re**learning mathematics that I should've pay attention to during high school. 

This project is a work in progress, and really isn't something that I courage use within production environments. Maybe one day it will be as good as **glMatrix** or **glm**.
